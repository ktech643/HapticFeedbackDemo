# Proximity-Based Haptic Feedback App

## Overview
This app provides haptic feedback that increases in intensity as your finger gets closer to a randomly placed dot on the screen. Once you touch the dot, a satisfying haptic click is triggered, and the dot resets to a new location.

## Features
- Dynamic dot placement within screen bounds.
- Proximity-based vibration feedback.
- Supports all screen sizes.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Select an iPhone simulator or device with haptic feedback.
3. Run the app.

## Assumptions
- The app assumes the device supports `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` for haptics.
